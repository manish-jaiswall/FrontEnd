    <p style="text-align:start">The smallest flower in the world comes from the Wolffia plant; commonly called watermeal, this plant is native to many parts of the world and is differentiated into about 9-11 different species. The Wolffia flower comes from a plant that is approximately the size of a single colored sprinkle that you see on the top of donuts. It is a small, aquatic plant that resembles cornmeal and is found in clumps floating on top of water. It is a type of Duckweed in the Lemnaceae family of plants. The flower itself is nestled in a small depression on the surface of the plant and it is said that a bouquet of Wolffia flowers would fit on the head of a pin.</p>
